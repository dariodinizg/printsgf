# Print SGF

Program to convert .sgf files to a printable format

Created just for fun! For the sake of those who want to stay away of the screens and replay the match in your goban.

I confess that I coded this app with a little haste in order to play matches in my goban. So, sorry if the code is not polished. And you may contact me for any bugs. 
If someone gets interested in this app, I might refactor the code.

Good game!
